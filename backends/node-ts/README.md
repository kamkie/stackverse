# Backend · Node.js (TypeScript)

The Stackverse backend on Node.js 24: **Fastify 5** over plain `pg`, JWT bearer
authentication with `jose` against Keycloak's JWKS, `pino` structured logging.
Shared behavior, endpoints, and environment variables are documented once in
[backends/README.md](../README.md) and the contract documents it points to —
this file covers only what is specific to this stack.

Framework choice: Fastify over Express for first-class async handlers, a real
plugin/hook model (the auth hook, the problem-document error handler), and a
pino logger built in — the idiomatic 2020s Node service shape. The rest of the
stack is deliberately thin: no ORM, no DI container, no validation framework.

## Run it locally

Prerequisites: Node.js ≥ 22 with corepack (Yarn Berry resolves from
`packageManager`), the compose infra (`docker compose up -d` at the repo root).

```sh
cd backends/node-ts
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start          # or: yarn dev (rebuild once, restart on dist changes)
```

Defaults match the compose infra (PostgreSQL on 5432, Keycloak on 8180); the
message seed resolves to the repo's `spec/messages` automatically. Migrations
(node-pg-migrate) apply on startup — the database must be one this backend owns
(when switching from another backend: `docker compose down -v` first, see
[docs/RUNNING.md](../../docs/RUNNING.md)).

Tests (plain unit tests, no containers):

```sh
yarn test           # vitest; yarn typecheck for tsc --noEmit
```

Conformance (the acceptance gate), with the backend running:

```sh
../../scripts/conformance.ps1        # or conformance.sh
```

Container image (repo root as context — the image ships the message seed),
from the repo root:

```sh
docker build -t stackverse/backend-node-ts:local -f backends/node-ts/Dockerfile .
```

## What this implementation demonstrates

- **Fastify hooks as the security boundary** — one `onRequest` hook does JWT
  validation, lazy account provisioning, and the blocked-account 403
  (`src/auth.ts`); route handlers ask for what they need with
  `requireCaller`/`requireRole`. The admin ⊃ moderator hierarchy stays in
  Keycloak.
- **SQL without an ORM** — hand-written parameterized queries per feature
  module (`src/routes/*.ts`), with a tiny `withTransaction` helper for the
  moderation state machine. What an ORM would hide — lock ordering, keyset
  predicates, partial unique indexes — is exactly the comparison material.
- **PostgreSQL arrays for tags** — `tags text[]` with a GIN index, as in the
  dotnet sibling; tag filters are array containment (`@>`), tag counts go
  through `unnest`. Contrast with spring-kotlin's join table.
- **Keyset pagination in plain SQL** — the v2 cursor is the same base64url
  `(created_at, id)` token as the reference backend, appended to the listing
  `WHERE` clause as one keyset predicate (`src/cursor.ts`).
- **Body-hash ETags** — `sendWithEtag` (`src/etag.ts`) hashes the serialized
  response, the same stateless revalidation scheme as the reference backend's
  `ShallowEtagHeaderFilter`; bundle and stats bodies are deterministically
  ordered so identical reads produce identical tags.
- **Yarn Berry PnP, ESM, tsc** — zero `node_modules`, matching the repo's
  other Node projects; the Docker runtime stage runs plain `node` with the
  PnP require hook + ESM loader, no Yarn in the image.
- **Observability** (docs/RUNNING.md) — the OpenTelemetry NodeSDK, wired in
  code (`src/otel.ts`: HTTP + pg instrumentation, OTLP/gRPC for
  traces/metrics/logs) and active only when `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=false`. Console
  lines pick up `trace_id`/`span_id` through a pino mixin reading the active
  span, and a pino stream bridges every record to the OTel Logs API — no
  monkey-patching of the logger.

## Deliberate deviations worth comparing

- Enum-like values are stored as their lowercase wire strings (`'public'`,
  `'open'`) — there is no enum layer to map through, so the database reads
  like the API. spring-kotlin stores uppercase constant names; dotnet derives
  the same lowercase strings from a naming policy.
- Optional response fields are *omitted*, not `null` — a small helper
  (`omitNulls`) instead of a serializer-wide `NON_NULL` setting.
- A malformed UUID in a path answers `404` (a malformed id cannot name an
  existing resource), where Spring's type conversion answers `400`. The
  contract only pins the valid-UUID cases; this is the kind of edge that
  differs between stacks unless someone pins it.

## Logging conformance

Status against the template in [docs/LOGGING.md](../../docs/LOGGING.md) §10;
`❌` rows are this implementation's agreed, visible backlog.

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| stdout-only logging | ✅ |
| OTLP log export behind `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` | ✅ (pino → OTel Logs API bridge) |
| lifecycle events at `INFO` | ✅ |
| expected 4xx not logged as errors | ✅ |
| secrets kept out of logs | ✅ |
| `LOG_LEVEL` honored | ✅ |
| trace id on console lines when tracing on | ✅ (pino mixin) |
| stable `event` names (§5: lifecycle, session, security, moderation) | ✅ |
| dependency events (§5: `dependency_call_failed`, `retry_exhausted`) | ✅¹ |
| JSON console by default (`LOG_FORMAT`) | ✅ (`text` → pino-pretty) |
| dev-only console forwarding, sanitized | n/a |
| dev-only user-action log (§9: `[action]`/`[nav]`/`[api]`, no field values) | n/a |

¹ `dependency_call_failed` is emitted for both of this backend's dependencies:
PostgreSQL (pool-level connection errors and the readiness probe's
ready→not-ready transition, with `duration_ms`) and Keycloak (OIDC discovery /
JWKS retrieval failure). There are no retry loops, so `retry_exhausted` has no
occurrence to log.
